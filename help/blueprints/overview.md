# Customer experience orchestration blueprints

Customer experience orchestration (formerly, _Digital Experience_) blueprints provide system and data flow architecture diagrams to help better understand how Adobe Experience Platform and Applications are integrated and implemented. The blueprints provide a visual representation of inter-system and component data and content flows, sequence of operations, and dependencies to help inform use case design and architecture of Adobe Experience Platform and Applications.
