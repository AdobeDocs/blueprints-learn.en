# Adobe Commerce & RTCDP

The [!DNL Data Connection] extension helps Adobe Commerce customers seamlessly integrate with Adobe Experience Platform to enrich the customer profile and personalize experiences in digital storefront and other channels.

## Technical Capablities Enabled

* Storefront data (client side, such as add to cart, cart abandons, and so on) collected and sent into any Adobe Experience Cloud product.
* Back office order status to any Adobe Experience Cloud product
* Back office historical orders can be sent to Adobe Experience Platform
* Share and personalize RTCDP audiences to Adobe Commerce

## Pre-requisites

To use the [!DNL Data Connection] extension, you must have the following:

* Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 or newer
* Adobe ID and Organization ID
* Adobe Experience Platform/RTCDP
* [Adobe Client Data Layer (ACDL)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extensions/client/client-data-layer/overview.html). The ACDL is required to collect storefront event data.

## Onboarding steps

### Data Collection from Adobe Commerce to Adobe Experience Platform

* [Install](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/fundamentals/install.html) the [!DNL Data Connection] extension.
* [Sign in](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/access-adobe-id-account.html) to your Adobe account and view to confirm your organization ID. The organization ID is the ID associated with your provisioned Experience Cloud company. This ID is a 24-character alphanumeric string, followed by (and must include) @AdobeOrg.
* [Create or update](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/fundamentals/update-xdm.html) your XDM schema with Commerce-specific field groups.
* [Create a dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-mobile-sdk/experience-cloud/platform.html#create-a-dataset) based off the schema you created or updated. This dataset will contain the Commerce data you send.
* [Create a datastream](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/overview.html) and select the XDM schema that contains the Commerce-specific field groups.
* [Connect to Commerce Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas.html).
