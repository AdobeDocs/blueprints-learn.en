## Guardrails

[Refer to the guardrails as outlined on the Audience and Profile Activation Overview page.](overview.md)  

## Implementation steps

1. [Create schemas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=ExperiencePlatform-D-1-2021.1.xdm) for data to be ingested.
1. [Create datasets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html) for data to be ingested.
1. [Configure the correct identities and identity namespaces](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/identities/label-ingest-and-verify-identity-data.html) on the schema to be sure that ingested data can stitch into a unified profile.
1. [Enable the schemas and datasets for profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/profiles/bring-data-into-the-real-time-customer-profile.html). 
1. [Ingest data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=ExperiencePlatform-D-1-2020.1.dataingestion) into Experience Platform.
1. [Provision [!UICONTROL Real-Time Customer Data Platform] segment sharing](https://www.adobe.com/go/audiences) between Experience Platform and Audience Manager for audiences defined in Experience Platform to be shared to Audience Manager.
1. [Create segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html) in Experience Platform. The system automatically determines whether the segment is evaluated as batch or streaming.
1. [Configure destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/destinations/create-destinations-and-activate-data.html) for sharing of profile attributes and audience memberships to desired destinations.
