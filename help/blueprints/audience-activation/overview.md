# Audience and Profile Activation

Audience and Profile activation is the key to success in a data-driven marketing world. However, many brands still focus their efforts on channel-first activation, which often delivers inconsistent reach and personalization.

With a channel-first approach, each channel acts as a silo in which personalization efforts target only the customers interacting with the brand on that channel. This approach doesn’t reflect the reality that customers interact with brands across many different touchpoints. Audience and Profile activation allows brands to connect customer interactions across multiple channels, to deliver a centralized profile and audience that can be activated to all channels.

### Activating attributes and identities

* [!UICONTROL The Real-time Customer Data Platform] can activate audience memberships as well as attribute and identity changes that occur for profiles that are members of segments selected for activation. If your goal is to activate attributes or identities, you must define a global segment that includes all the profiles to which attribute and identity updates are sent. At that point, you can select the segment and desired attributes to activate as part of the destination configuration.
* Note that batch destinations do not support activation of attribute-only change events. Full or incremental audience memberships can be sent along with the selected attributes for activation, but you cannot activate attribute-only change events via batch destinations.  

### Activating batch segments to streaming destinations

* Batch Segment Activation to Streaming Destinations is supported. Batch segment jobs place messages on the pipeline once the segment job is complete for streaming activation

### Activating streaming segments to batch destinations

* Streaming segment activation to batch destinations is supported. The batch destination schedule exports profile segment memberships based on the batch destination schedule. This includes both segment memberships determined via streaming and batch methods.

### Activating of experience events

* Activating raw experience events is not supported. To activate against experience events, a segment must be created with the necessary rules that include or exclude the experience event logic. This creates a segment that is defined against experience events, and the segment membership can be activated as a proxy for activating raw experience events. Also consider using [!UICONTROL Launch Server Side] to activate raw experience events collected via SDK.
