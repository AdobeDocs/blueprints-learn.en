# Audience Activation blueprint

Audience-first activation is the key to success in a data-driven marketing world. However, many brands are still focusing their efforts on channel-first activation, which often delivers inconsistent reach and personalization. With a channel-first approach, each channel acts as a silo in which personalization efforts target only the customers interacting with the brand on that channel. The problem with this approach is that it doesn’t reflect the reality that customers interact with brands across many different touchpoints. Channel-first activation cannot connect customers’ behavior through their interactions across multiple channels resulting in lost opportunities for stronger engagement and the revenues it generates.
