# B2B Analysis

B2B analysis can be accomplished in Customer Journey Analytics by specifying the data at an account level rather than at a person level for analysis. Additionally account level data can be related to person level data by using account based lookup datasets tied to persons in Customer Journey Analytics.

Account-level analysis can answer questions such as

* What company name is matched with this account?
* How many employees are associated with this account/company?
* What roles are represented in this account?
* How is this account performing as a whole with respect to a specific marketing campaign, compared to another account?
* Are certain roles (such as IT Manager) at one account behaving differently than the same role at a different account?
