# Activation with Online & Offline Data Blueprint

Use offline attributes and events such as offline orders, transactions, CRM, or loyalty data, along with online behavior for online targeting and personalization.

Activate audiences to known profile-based destinations such as email providers, social networks, and advertising destinations. 

The Activation with online and offline data blueprint aligns closely with the [Audience and Profile Activation with Experience Cloud Applications Blueprint](platform-and-applications.md). Additional detail is provided in the [Audience and Profile Activation with Experience Cloud Applications Blueprint](platform-and-applications.md)   specific to integrations between Experience Platform and Experience Cloud Applications.

## Use Cases

* Audience targeting for known audiences on social and advertising destinations.
* Online personalization with online and offline attributes.
* Activate audiences to known channels, such as email and SMS.

## Applications

* Adobe Experience Platform
* [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Data Platform]

## Guardrails

[Refer to the guardrails as outlined on the Audience and Profile Activation Overview page.](overview.md)  

## Implementation Steps

1. [Create schemas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=ExperiencePlatform-D-1-2021.1.xdm) for data to be ingested.
1. [Create datasets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html) for data to be ingested.
1. [Configure the correct identities and identity namespaces](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/identities/label-ingest-and-verify-identity-data.html) on the schema to be sure that ingested data can stitch into a unified profile.
1. [Enable the schemas and datasets for profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/profiles/bring-data-into-the-real-time-customer-profile.html). 
1. [Ingest data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?recommended=ExperiencePlatform-D-1-2020.1.dataingestion) into Experience Platform.
1. [Provision [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Data Platform] segment sharing](https://www.adobe.com/go/audiences) between Experience Platform and Audience Manager for audiences defined in Experience Platform to be shared to Audience Manager.
1. [Create segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html) in Experience Platform. The system automatically determines whether the segment is evaluated as batch or streaming.
1. [Configure destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/destinations/create-destinations-and-activate-data.html) for sharing of profile attributes and audience memberships to desired destinations.

## Implementation Considerations

* Sharing profile data to destinations requires that you include the specific identity value used by the destination in the destination payload. Any identity that is necessary for a target destination must be ingested into Platform and configured as an identity for the [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Profile].

* For activation scenarios where audiences are shared from Experience Platform to Audience Manager the following identities are shared automatically: IDFA, GAID, AdCloud, Google, ECID, EMAIL_LC_SHA256. Currently, customer namespaces are not shared. The audiences from Experience Platform can be shared through Audience Manager destinations when the required destination identities are included in the [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Profile], or where identities in the [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Profile] can be related to the required destination identities that are linked in Audience Manager.
