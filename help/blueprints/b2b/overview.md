# B2B Analytics & Activation blueprints

B2B Audience and Profile activation is the key to success in a data-driven marketing world. However, many brands still focus their efforts on channel-first activation, which often delivers inconsistent reach and personalization.

With a channel-first approach, each channel acts as a silo in which personalization efforts target only the customers interacting with the brand on that channel. This approach doesn't reflect the reality that customers interact with brands across many different touch-points. B2B Audience and Profile activation allows brands to connect customer interactions across multiple channels, align that to their respective account and opportunity based information to deliver a centralized profile and audience that can be activated to all channels.
