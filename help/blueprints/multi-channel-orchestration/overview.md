# Multi-channel Orchestration blueprint

Multi-channel message orchestration addresses the ability for brands to proactively engage and communicate with their customers through channels such as email, SMS, and mobile alerts. Orchestration tools can also be integrated with other interaction channels such as with inbound channels for web/mobile personalization by sharing audience state with the other channel specific decision engines. A number of factors go into what applications and deployment options should be used for Multi-channel message orchestration, including whether the customer interaction will be trigger based or scheduled, as well as what data will be necessary for the required targeting and personalization of the interactions. This results in a number of possible scenarios and deployment options when building out message orchestration capability.
