# Telecommunications industry business challenge

Before implementing this Blueprint the telecommunications company's "add a new line" email campaigns relied on whether the user had converted and only checked for this after a 7-day waiting period. Once these criteria were met any additional touch-points were initiated. 

This limitation had to be solved in order to initiate a timelier follow-up to users wished wanted to add a line earlier than the current state 7-day waiting period. 

## Adobe approach

* Adobe Analytics data to identify users who failed to convert to add a new line are included as a data source for use by Adobe Journey Optimizer.
* Adobe Journey Optimizer uses a rule to time when customer's receive a customized "abandon" message designed to encourage a customer to convert by adding a new line to their account.
