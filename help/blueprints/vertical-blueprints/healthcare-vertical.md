# Healthcare Shield

Healthcare Shield is an Adobe Experience Platform add-on to Adobe Experience Platform-based applications, such as Real-Time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics, and Adobe Journey Optimizer, that is designed to make these applications HIPAA ready to meet the requirements around the processing and usage of Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Frequently Asked Questions about Healthcare Shield

The following FAQ provides answers to common questions about Healthcare Shield.

### What is HIPAA?

HIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), a US regulation that establishes important protections for limiting the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) when created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a HIPAA covered entity or business associates (such as Adobe customers) to a business associate (technology partners such as Adobe).

Adobe is HIPAA ready as a business associate with respect to the specific HIPAA ready Adobe solutions and compliance with the HIPAA Security, Privacy, and Breach Notification rules.

### What is a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and why is it important?

When a Covered Entity or Business Associate (an Adobe customer) uses the services of a Business Associate (such as Adobe) to create, receive, maintain, or transmit certain types of consumer data that is Protected Healthcare Data (PHI) or ePHI (electronic version of PHI), the Covered Entity and Business Associate are required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

The BAA contractually requires Adobe, as the Business Associate to appropriately safeguard PHI by complying with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.

With the Healthcare Shield add-on for Real-Time CDP, Adobe is now able to execute a BAA with customers who license this capability along with Adobe Real-Time CDP B2C and the consumer flows of Adobe Real-Time CDP B2P Edition.

### Why is Healthcare Shield for Real-Time CDP (and future Platform-based applications) available only in the US?

Since HIPAA is a US law, we are limiting Healthcare Shield's availability to the US and to companies that are subject to HIPAA. Adobe intends to expand coverage to other jurisdictions as we scope local requirements and are confident we can meet them.

### What is the Healthcare Shield for Real-Time CDP?

Healthcare Shield for Real-Time CDP is for customers who are a Covered Entity or Business Associate and intend to leverage PHI in Real-Time CDP for data ingestion, audience creation and cross channel activation, as well as require Adobe to execute a BAA. Healthcare Shield is required for Covered Entities with HIPAA required use cases for Real- Time CDP.

### Why should healthcare prospects of Real-Time CDP purchase Healthcare Shield?

As an add-on to Real-Time CDP, Healthcare Shield upgrades the application to a "HIPAA-ready" status. This means that the application has the safeguards in place to leverage PHI in accordance with HIPAA requirements. Additionally, with Healthcare Shield, Adobe is willing and able to authorize the customer to bring in certain types of Permitted Sensitive Personal Data to the HIPAA-ready application. Adobe will sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with customers that license Healthcare Shield for a compatible Platform-based application.

### What types of data are authorized for Real-Time CDP with Healthcare Shield (and which ones are not)?

With Healthcare Shield, brands may bring the following PHI into Platform-based applications such as Real-Time CDP ("Permitted Sensitive Personal Data"): an individual's financial information, medical or health information. But we are specifically excluding data that can be used to identify substance abuse, mental health, genetic health records, or health records of a minor, full account number, full credit card numbers, government identifiers (such as SSN), and personal information of children protected under any child protection laws (such as the personal information defined under the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Act ("COPPA")).

### With Healthcare Shield, can Real-Time CDP customers use any type of PHI to build audiences and activate them?

Even when a customer may bring Permitted Sensitive Personal Data into Platform-native applications, customers need to understand that they are solely responsible for staying in compliance with all applicable regulations and obtaining appropriate permissions, consents, clearances, and authorizations from consumers to use data in the intended ways.

### What are the nuances of ingesting and activating customer data with non-HIPAA-ready Adobe applications?

A customer licensing Healthcare Shield may not use, ingest, collect, share, or integrate Permitted Sensitive Personal Data with any non-HIPAA-Ready Adobe applications and services. For example, a customer should not activate segments that contain PHI in applications such as Audience Manager, Adobe Target, and Adobe Analytics. Customers licensing Healthcare Shield may ingest Permitted Sensitive Personal Data or authorized PHI into HIPAA-ready Adobe applications, regardless of whether the data source is considered HIPAA ready or not.

### What are the nuances of ingesting and activating customer data with non-HIPAA-ready non-Adobe applications?

A customer licensing Healthcare Shield should use good judgement to determine where they activate segments that contain PHI outside of Adobe applications. Adobe does not control and is not responsible for third-party providers and data sent by a customer to a third-party provider may not support the processing of data in accordance with Adobe data usage labels in the customers schema. Additionally, Adobe cannot provide legal advice to our customers.

![](Aspose.Words.749b0c49-3370-4549-9a4d-bf21df8fbfb8.001.png)

This section outlines some best practices to follow and is divided into three phases:
### **Interview Phase:**
The interview process with stakeholders is key to understand the following aspects:

- Objective: Type of use-cases -  Conversion, Prospecting, Engagement etc.
- Performance: Any Service Level Target expectations
- Data sources: Web/Analytics, Offline/Online, CRM, Loyalty etc.
- Volume of data
- SLT/SLA requirements
- Identities - Number of identities, authenticated vs anonymous data handling
- Format of the data: JSON, CSV etc.
- Quality of data, need for data transformations
- Any plans for Segment Match (Sharing) with Partners 
- Any external audiences to be imported
- Encryption: Default vs Customer Managed Key
- Co-mingling of data: is considered e-PHI
- Consent Data Collection - OneTrust, Consent SDK
- Destination needs: Frequency and Latency and  Access control requirements
- Access Control
- Data Cleanup requirements
- Data Update requirements
- Alerting needs
- API access

### **Design Phase:**
Based on the interview process, the design phase will address the following. Needless to say, the design documentation needs to be reviewed and
signed off. The design document can cover the following aspects:

- Value of Data:
  - Volume - Amount of Data Ingested
  - Timespan - Length of time the ingested data should reside
  - Fidelity - Profile richness
- Consider AEP guardrails along with SLT/SLA requirements 
- License Usage
- Data Isolation needs - multiple sandboxes in single or multiple orgs
- Data Filtering
- Data Hygiene requirements (amount of data and frequency)
- Process and methodology to meet data delete/update requirements 
- Data Transformation needs - Upstream, Data prep, Query Service
- Understand and determine Primary and other identities
- [XDM Schema Design](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition.html?lang=en)
- Determine number of datasets, profiled vs un-profiled
- Merge Policy design
- Consent Data Management
- Governance: Roles, Labels, Policies, Marketing Actions and Access Control
- [Profile Enrichment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/guardrails.html?lang=en)
- Segmentation Design requirements for Edge/Streaming/Batch
- Expected Destinations and activation plans. Consider HIPAA ready only destination needs
- Plans for Analytics
- Alerts
- Add API access requirements

### **Implementation Phase:**
Once the design document is reviewed and signed off, the implementation phase can begin to address the following areas:

- Number of Sandboxes required: Dev/Test/Prod
- Access Control to sandboxes
- Deployment methodology
- TTL needs and frequency (Data Hygiene)
- XDM Schema and access control
- Consent enforcement
- Governance: Roles, Labels, Policies and Marketing Actions 
- Segmentation
- Datasets and access control
- Data Hygiene setup
- Destinations setup and access control
- Setup alerts
- Implement API access requirements
- Testing end to end with mock data
