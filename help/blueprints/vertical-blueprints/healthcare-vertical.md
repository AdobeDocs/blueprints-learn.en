# Healthcare Shield

Healthcare Shield is an Adobe Experience Platform add-on to Adobe Experience Platform-based applications like Real-Time Customer Data Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, and Adobe Journey Optimizer. It is designed to make these applications HIPAA-ready and meet the requirements around the processing and usage of Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Frequently asked questions about Healthcare Shield

The following FAQ provides answers to common questions about Healthcare Shield.

### What is HIPAA?

HIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It's a U.S. regulation that establishes important protections for business. These protections limit the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) when created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a HIPAA covered entity or business associates (such as Adobe customers) to a business associate (technology partners such as Adobe).

Adobe is HIPAA-ready as a business associate regarding the specific HIPAA-ready Adobe solutions and compliance with the HIPAA Security, Privacy, and Breach Notification rules.

### What is a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and why is it important?

When a Covered Entity or Business Associate (an Adobe customer) uses the services of a Business Associate (such as Adobe) to create, receive, maintain, or transmit certain types of consumer data that is Protected Healthcare Data (PHI) or ePHI (electronic version of PHI), the Covered Entity and Business Associate are required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

The BAA contractually requires Adobe, as the Business Associate to appropriately safeguard PHI by complying with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.

With the Healthcare Shield add-on for Real-Time CDP, Adobe is now able to execute a BAA with customers who license this capability along with Adobe Real-Time CDP B2C and the consumer flows of Adobe Real-Time CDP B2P Edition.

### Why is Healthcare Shield for Real-Time CDP (and future Platform-based applications) available only in the US?

Since HIPAA is a US law, we are limiting Healthcare Shield's availability to the US and to companies that are subject to HIPAA. Adobe intends to expand coverage to other jurisdictions as we scope local requirements and are confident we can meet them.

### What is the Healthcare Shield for Real-Time CDP?

Healthcare Shield for Real-Time CDP is for customers who are a Covered Entity or Business Associate and intend to use PHI in Real-Time CDP for data ingestion, audience creation and cross-channel activation, as well as require Adobe to execute a BAA. Healthcare Shield is required for Covered Entities with HIPAA required use cases for Real- Time CDP.

### Why should healthcare prospects of Real-Time CDP purchase Healthcare Shield?

As an add-on to Real-Time CDP, Healthcare Shield upgrades the application to a "HIPAA-ready" status. This means that the application has the safeguards in place to use PHI in accordance with HIPAA requirements. Also, with Healthcare Shield, Adobe is willing and able to authorize the customer to bring in certain types of Permitted Sensitive Personal Data to the HIPAA-ready applications. Adobe signs Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with customers that license Healthcare Shield for a compatible Platform-based application.

### What types of data are authorized for Real-Time CDP with Healthcare Shield (and which ones are not)?

With Healthcare Shield, brands may bring the following PHI into Platform-based applications such as Real-Time CDP (Permitted Sensitive Personal Data): 

* An individual's financial information
* Medical
* Health information

But we are specifically excluding data that identifies substance abuse, mental health, genetic health records, or health records of a minor, full account number, full credit card numbers, government identifiers (such as SSN), and personal information of children. Children are protected under any child protection laws (such as the personal information defined under the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Act (COPPA)).

### With Healthcare Shield, can Real-Time CDP customers use any type of PHI to build audiences and activate them?

Even when a customer may bring Permitted Sensitive Personal Data into Platform-native applications, customers need to understand that they are solely responsible for staying in compliance with all applicable regulations and obtaining appropriate permissions, consents, clearances, and authorizations from consumers to use data in the intended ways.

### What are the nuances of ingesting and activating customer data with non-HIPAA-ready Adobe applications?

A customer licensing Healthcare Shield may not use, ingest, collect, share, or integrate Permitted Sensitive Personal Data with any non-HIPAA-Ready Adobe applications and services. 

For example, a customer should not activate segments that contain PHI in applications such as Audience Manager, Adobe Target, and Adobe Analytics. Customers licensing Healthcare Shield may ingest Permitted Sensitive Personal Data or authorized PHI into HIPAA-ready Adobe applications, regardless of whether the data source is considered HIPAA ready or not.

### What are the nuances of ingesting and activating customer data with non-HIPAA-ready non-Adobe applications?

A customer licensing Healthcare Shield should use good judgement to determine where they activate segments that contain PHI outside of Adobe applications. Adobe does not control (and is not responsible for) third-party providers and data sent by a customer to a third-party provider that may not support the processing of data in accordance with Adobe data usage labels in the customers schema. Additionally, Adobe cannot provide legal advice to our customers.
