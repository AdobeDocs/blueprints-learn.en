# Event Forwarding blueprint

The Event Forwarding Blueprint shows how data collected with Adobe Experience Platform Web and Mobile SDKs can be forwarded from Experience Platform Edge Network to a desired destination. You can forward all raw data collected from the SDKs or specific data based on events and rules as configured in tag properties (formerly Launch).

## Use cases

* Collect data from web or mobile using a single collection tag, lightening code weight on client browsers and apps. Propagate the collected data to various endpoints for a single source of data collection.
* Forward collected data to partner applications or data storage locations for building insights and applications against the collected data.

## Applications

* Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
