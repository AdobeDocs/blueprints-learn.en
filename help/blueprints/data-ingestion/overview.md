# Data Collection and Preparation

Data Collection and Preparation encompasses all the methods by which data can be prepared and ingested into Adobe Experience Platform. As well as the ability to collect data to Adobe Experience Platform's Edge Network for Server Side forwarding to enterprise destinations.

Data preparation includes the mapping source data to Experience Data Model (XDM) schema. It also includes performing transformations on data, including date formatting, field splitting/concatenation/conversions, and joining/merging/re-keying of records. Data preparation helps unify customer data to provide aggregated/filtered analysis, including reporting or preparing data for customer profile assembly/data science/activation.
