# Custom Data Science for Profile Enrichment Blueprint

Custom Data Science for Profile Enrichment Blueprint illustrates how data in Adobe Experience Platform can be used to train, deploy, and score models to provide machine learning insights into Experience Platform and the Real-time Customer Data Platform from data science and machine learning tools. Modeled insights can be ingested into Experience Platform to enrich the real-time customer profile. Examples of machine learning insights include lifetime value scoring, product and category affinity, propensity to convert, or propensity to churn. 

## Use Cases

* Extract insight and discover patterns from customer data, train and score models from this data.
* Enrich the [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Profile] with model driven insights and attributes for more granular personalization and optimized journeys.
* Train and Score models to determine customer insights such as customer lifetime value, propensity to convert or churn, product and content affinities, and engagement scores.
