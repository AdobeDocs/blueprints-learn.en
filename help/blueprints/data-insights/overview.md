# Data analysis, intelligence, and AI/ML blueprints

Data analysis, intelligence, and AI/ML comprises the ability within Adobe [!DNL Experience Platform] to perform exploratory query and analysis of the data that exists in the data lake.

[!DNL Experience Platform]'s [!UICONTROL Query Service] allows SQL queries to be performed on the data. In addition, [!DNL Experience Platform] allows connections with third-party SQL clients, interfaces, and Business Intelligence (BI) tools to directly connect to, access and query the data within [!DNL Experience Platform], using the [!DNL PostgreSQL] protocol.
