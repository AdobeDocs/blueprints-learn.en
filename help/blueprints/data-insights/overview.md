# Data Analysis, Intelligence, & AI/ML

Enterprise Data Exploration and Reporting comprises the ability within Adobe Experience Platform to perform exploratory query and analysis of the data that exists in the data lake.

Experience Platform's Query Service allows SQL queries to be performed on the data. The Data Science Workspace enables data exploration, data science, and machine learning workloads to be performed on the data. 

In addition, Experience Platform allows connections with third-party SQL clients, interfaces, and Business Intelligence (BI) tools to directly connect to, access and query the data within Experience Platform, using the PostgreSQL protocol.

Certain guardrails apply for the query timeout and for the amount of data that is included in the query result, as noted within the scenario details.
