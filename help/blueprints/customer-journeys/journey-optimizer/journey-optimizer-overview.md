## Blueprint Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Technical Considerations |
| :-- | :--- | :--- |
| [3rd-party Messaging](3rd-party-messaging.md) | Demonstrates how Adobe [!DNL Journey Optimizer] can integrate with third-party messaging platforms to orchestrate and deliver personalized customer communications. | <ul><li>The third-party system must support **bearer token authentication**</li><li>**Static IPs are not supported** due to the multi-tenant architecture.</li><li>Be aware of **API rate limits** on third-party systems; customers may need to purchase additional capacity to handle traffic originating from **Adobe Journey Optimizer**.</li><li>**Decision Management** is not supported within message payloads or delivery logic.</li></ul> |

## Integration Patterns

| Integration | Description | Technical Considerations |
| :-- | :--- | :--- |
