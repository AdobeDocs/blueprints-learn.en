# [!DNL Journey Optimizer] - Campaign Orchestrataion Blueprint

AJO Campaign Orchestration enables marketers to design and execute scheduled, audience-based, multi-step communications across outbound channels like email, sms, push and direct mail. Unlike AJO Journeys, which react to individual customer behaviors using real-time data from the Real-Time Customer Profile, campaigns are coordinated marketing efforts that target audiences at planned intervals. Together, campaigns and journeys offer complementary approachesâ€”campaigns drive brand engagement strategies, while journeys deliver personalized, responsive experiences.

## Architectural Considerations for Journeys

- **Data Architecture**: AJO Campaign Orchestration utilizes a relational database underneath for audience building and orchestration
- **Audience Portal Integration**: natively integrated with the Audience Portal within the Real-Time Customer Profile to both read existing audiences from and save new audiences to when building campaigns
- **On-demand Audience Creation**: build, evaluate and execute an audience immediately for urgent marketing use cases
- **Real-Time Customer Profile Integration:** the Real-Time Customer Profile remains the source of truth for consent and communication history and therefore should always be considered during design to hold a "skinny profile" (i.e. the basic traits of a person needed for personalization)
- **Multi-entity Message Sending:** ability to send multiple messages per profile in a single delivery (e.g. send one message per reservation to the customer email address)
- **Multi-entity Segmentation**: start building an audience from any entity within the relational store (i.e. product, inventory, plan, etc.)
