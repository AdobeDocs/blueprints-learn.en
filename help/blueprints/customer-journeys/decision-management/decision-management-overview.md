Adobe Decision Management is a service provided as part of Adobe Journey Optimizer. This blueprint outlines the use cases and technical capabilities of the application and provides a deep dive into the various architectural components and considerations that make up Decision Management.

Journey Optimizer is used to deliver the best offer and experience to your customers across all touch points at the right time. Decision Management makes personalization easy with a central library of marketing offers and a decision engine that applies rules and constraints to rich, real-time profiles created by Adobe Experience Platform to help you send your customers the right offer at the right time.

The Decision Management capability consists in two main components:

* The Centralized Offer Library which is the interface where you create and manage the different elements that compose your offers, and define their rules and constraints.
* The Offer Decision Engine which leverages Adobe Experience Platform data and Real-time Customer profiles, along with the Offer Library, in order to select the right time, customers and channels to which offers will be delivered.

Decision Management can be deployed in one of two ways, on the edge or via the hub. Each of these methods has a specific set of interfaces and protocols for operating the service as outlined in the respective blueprints referenced below. Additional details can also be obtained in the [Decision Management documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioniong/api-reference/offer-delivery-api/decisioning-vs-edge-apis.html).

## Decision Management on the hub

The first is via the Adobe Experience Platform hub, which is a central data center architecture. The hub architecture is best suited for customer experiences that do not demand low latency and high throughput, but do require a fuller view of the customer profile, examples include offer decisions which are provided for kiosks or agent assisted experiences such as in call centers or in person interactions. Offers that are inserted into emails, SMS messages, or push notifications and other outbound campaigns are also powered by the hub approach. To learn more about Decision Management on the hub refer to the [Decision Management on the hub](decision-management-hub.md) blueprint.

Decision Management on the Edge is designed to serve real-time consumer experiences such as web or mobile inbound personalization requests.
