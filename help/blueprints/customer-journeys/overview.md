# Customer Journeys 

Customer Journeys addresses the ability for brands to proactively engage and communicate with their customers through channels such as email, SMS, and mobile alerts. Orchestration tools can also be integrated with other interaction channels such as with inbound channels for web/mobile personalization by sharing audience state with the other channel specific decision engines. A number of factors go into what applications and deployment options should be used for Customer Journeys but it can be summed up in two different approaches:  react to a customer as they engage (triggered) OR react to a group of customers as they engage (scheduled).
