# Customer Journey Blueprints

Modern marketing teams require platforms that can support both reactive engagement—responding to individual customer behaviors—and proactive outreach—initiating campaigns that guide audiences into conversion funnels. These use cases span channels like email, SMS, push, and increasingly, web and in-app experiences.

Adobe Journey Optimizer and Adobe Campaign v8 both support two foundational models for customer engagement:

Customer-triggered journeys: Event-driven, real-time orchestration based on individual behaviors and signals.
Brand-initiated campaigns: Strategically timed pushes that introduce audiences into engagement funnels based on segmentation or business logic.
Both solutions enable outbound communication across traditional and digital channels. AJO additionally supports integration with inbound channels (e.g., web and mobile apps) through audience state sharing and decisioning services, allowing for unified cross-channel personalization.

The selection between these tools depends on architectural considerations such as latency tolerance, channel requirements, data integration strategy, and scalability.
