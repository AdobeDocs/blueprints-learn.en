# Web/Mobile Personalization with known customer data

## Use Cases

* Online personalization with known customer data
* Landing page optimization
* Personalization based on prior product/content views, product/content affinity, environmental attributes, and demographics in addition to offline data such as transactions, loyalty and CRM data, and modeled insights
* Share and target audiences defined in Real-time Customer Data Platform on websites and mobile apps using Adobe Target.

## Applications

* [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Data Platform]
* Adobe Target
* Adobe Audience Manager (optional): Adds third-party audience data
* Adobe Analytics or Customer Journey Analytics(optional): Adds the ability to build segments based on historical customer and behavioral data with fine grained segmentation

## Implementation Patterns

Known Customer Personalization is supported via several implementation approaches.

### Implementation Pattern 1 - Edge Network with Web/Mobile SDK or Edge Network API (Recommended Approach)

* Using the Edge Network with the Web/Mobile SDK. Real-time edge segmentation requires the Web/Mobile SDK or Edge API implementation approach.
* [Refer to the Experience Platform Web and Mobile SDK Blueprint](../data-ingestion/websdk.md) for the SDK based implementation.
* For use in the Mobile SDK the [Adobe Journey Optimizer - Decisioning extension](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-journey-optimizer-decisioning) must be installed in the Mobile SDK.
* [Refer to the Edge Network Server API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge-network-server-api/overview.html) for an API based implementation of Adobe Target with Edge Profile.

### Implementation Pattern 2 - Application specific SDKs

Using traditional application-specific SDKs (for example, AT.js and AppMeasurement.js). Real-time Edge segment evaluation is not supported using this implementation approach. However streaming and batch audience sharing from Experience Platform hub are supported using this implemenation approach.

[Refer to the application specific SDK Blueprint](../data-ingestion/appsdk.md) 

### Implementation Steps

1. [Implement Adobe Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/implement-target/implementing-target.html) for your web or mobile applications
1. [Implement Experience Platform and [!UICONTROL Real-time Customer Profile]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/getting-started-for-data-architects-and-data-engineers/overview.html) ensure that audiences created are activated to the Edge by configuring the applicable [merge policy](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/merge-policies/ui-guide.html?lang=en#create-a-merge-policy) as active on the Edge. 
1. Implement [Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html) or the [Experience Platform Mobile SDK](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/) with the correct extension (Target or Adobe Journey Optimizer - Decisioning) installed. Experience Platform Web/Mobile SDK or EDGE API are required for real-time Edge segmentation, but not required for sharing of streaming and batch audiences from Real-time Customer Data Platform to Target.
1. [Configure the Edge Network with a Edge Datastream](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/datastreams.html)
1. [Enable Adobe Target as a destination within Real-time Customer Data Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/personalization/adobe-target-connection.html?lang=en)
1. (Optional) [Implement Adobe Audience Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/implement-audience-manager.html).
1. (Optional) [Request provisioning for Audience Sharing between Experience Platform and Adobe Target (Shared Audiences)](https://www.adobe.com/go/audiences) to share audiences from Experience Platform to Target.

## Implementation Considerations

Identity pre-requisites

* Any primary identity can be leveraged when utilizing implementation pattern 1 outlined above with the Edge network and WebSDK. First login personalization requires the personalization request set primary identity match the primary identity of the profile from Real-time Customer Data Platform. Identity stitching between anonymous devices and known customers is processed on the hub and subsequently projected to the edge.
* Note that data uploaded to the hub prior to a consumer visiting or logging into a website will not be immediately available for personalization. An active edge profile must first exist for hub data to be synced to. Once created the edge profile will sync with the hub profile asynchronously resulting in next page personalization. 
* Sharing audiences from Adobe Experience Platform to Adobe Target requires the use of ECID as a identity when using the audience sharing service as outlined in integration patter 2 and 3 above.
* Alternate identities can be used to share Experience Platform audiences to Adobe Target via Audience Manager as well. Experience Platform activates audiences to Audience Manager via the following supported namespaces: IDFA, GAID, AdCloud, Google, ECID, EMAIL_LC_SHA256. Note that Audience Manager and Target resolve audience memberships via the ECID identity, so ECID is still required to be in the identity graph for the consumer for the final audience sharing to Adobe Target.
