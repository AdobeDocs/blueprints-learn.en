Audience Sharing: By default the segment sharing service allows a maximum of 75 audiences to be shared for each Analytics report suite. If AAM is being used for audience sharing there is no limit on the number of audiences that can be shared.Â 

## Implementation Steps

* Implement AAM or Analytics
* Implement Visitor ID service
* Provision People and Audience Sharing services

## Data Flow Implementation Diagram

The Web/Mobile personalization blueprint can be implemented using either traditional app specific SDKs, or by using the WebSDK and Experience Edge Network.
