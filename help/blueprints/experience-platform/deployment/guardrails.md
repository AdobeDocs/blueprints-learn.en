# Guardrails and End to End Latencies

Guardrails are recommended thresholds that provide guidance for data, observed latencies and system usage in Adobe Experience Platform and applications. Guardrails reflect system constraints and performance expectations to optimize customer architecture and use case performance, and help to avoid errors or unexpected results. Guardrails are not intended to be service level agreements. 

For information on specific service level agreements for applications and features, refer to the [Application and feature descriptions](#application-feature-descriptions) section at the bottom of this page.
