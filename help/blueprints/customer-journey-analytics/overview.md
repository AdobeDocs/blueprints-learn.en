# Customer Journey Analytics 

Customer Journey Analytics shows how brands can unify customer data and behavior from various interaction channels and sources to create a journey-based view of all customer interactions. Reporting and analysis can be performed in the Customer Journey Analytics application service to evaluate and gain insight into customer interaction and behavior patterns. 

Common analyses include:

* Top/bottom converting paths
* Top viewed content
* Categories and products
* What campaigns resulted in conversion and increased engagement
* Tool usage analysis to optimize self-service experiences
